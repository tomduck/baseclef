Bassclef builds static Web pages from plain old text files using command-line tools.  The results are suitable for viewing from either a computer or a mobile.

It's a featherweight [CMS] for the impatient.  There are no dababases or programming frameworks.  Content is king.

Bassclef was [inspired] by Tyler Cipriani's "Replacing Jekyll with Pandoc and a Makefile", and can be used to generate [GitHub Pages] for your [GitHub] project.  It was initially developed (and continues) to manage my blog at <http://tomduck.ca/>.
