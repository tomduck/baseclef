Bassclef
========

Bassclef is a static Web page generator that processes plain old text files using command-line tools.  It's a featherweight [CMS] for the impatient.  There are no dababases or programming frameworks.  Content is king.

Bassclef was [inspired] by Tyler Cipriani's "Replacing Jekyll with Pandoc and a Makefile".  It can be used to generate [GitHub Pages]; the [bassclef documentation] is one such example.  An example standalone site is <http://tomduck.ca/>.

Although bassclef is being used in production, this is an alpha release. Once the codebase stabilizes there will be a beta release. The most recent sources can always be found at the [bassclef repository page]. Please feel welcome to report any [issues] that you encounter.
