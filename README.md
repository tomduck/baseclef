Bassclef CMS
============

Bassclef is a static Web site generator that processes plain old text files using stable and mature command-line tools.  It is a simple [CMS] for those who need to maintain a high degree of control over their work.

This project was [inspired] by Tyler Cipriani's "Replacing Jekyll with Pandoc and a Makefile".  Content is written in [markdown] and processed using [GNU make], [pandoc], and [python].  Enter `make` on the command line and bassclef builds your site.

Bassclef powers the author's [blog].  It may also be used to generate [GitHub Pages]; bassclef's documentation is one such example.

Workflow Example
----------------

Suppose we save the following to `bassclef/markdown/hello.md`:

~~~
Hello, world!
=============

It's a bright sunshiny day.
~~~

To build the html, open a terminal and `cd` into `bassclef/`.  Run `make`.  The generated html is saved in `bassclef/www/` along with all of the css, images and so on.

To test the results, run `make serve` from the terminal (type `^C` to exit) and point your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello.html`.

That's it!


Motivation
----------

Over the years I have built and deployed numerous small Web sites.  Long-term sustainability has proved to be a problem.  The initial ease-of-use of comprehensive CMSes and programming frameworks inevitably gives way to upgrade and migration headaches.  Extracting content that represents many hours of work can be a practical impossibility.

These tools are not without merit.  Comprehensive CMSes and programming frameworks are useful for creating large-scale, dynamic sites.  The vast majority of Web sites don't need -- and would be better off without -- these capabilities.

Bassclef is my effort to build a simple CMS for small-scale, static sites.  I had a look at static site generators like [Jekyll] and [yst], and found that they didn't quite suit my needs.  Jekyll was going to require a lot of time to figure out, an investment that would need repeating after any time away.  I needed something simpler.  Yst, on the other hand, is a template system that does not provide its own css, fonts, social media widgets, etc.  I needed something more.  Bassclef occupies a space in between these two options.
