Bassclef
========

Bassclef is a static Web page generator that processes plain old text files using command-line tools.  It's a featherweight [CMS] for the impatient.  There are no dababases or programming frameworks.  Content is king.

Bassclef was [inspired] by Tyler Cipriani's "Replacing Jekyll with Pandoc and a Makefile".  It can be used to generate [GitHub Pages]; the [bassclef documentation] is one such example.  An example standalone site is <http://tomduck.ca/>.

Although bassclef is being used in production, this should be considered an alpha release.  Issues can be reported on the [bassclef repository page] at [GitHub].
