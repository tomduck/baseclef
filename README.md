Bassclef
========

Bassclef is a featherweight [CMS] for the impatient.  Plain old text files (written in [markdown]) are processed using standard command-line tools (Makefiles, [pandoc], [python], and [ImageMagick] convert) to generate static Web pages.  Responsive CSS (via [Skeleton]) is used so that the resulting pages look good on devices big and small.

This project was [inspired] by Tyler Cipriani's "Replacing Jekyll with Pandoc and a Makefile".  It was written as a way to escape the long-term maintenance challenges presented to small-scale projects by databasing CMSes and programming frameworks.  Standard tools don't change, and your content files are never hidden.

Bassclef is used to power the author's blog at <http://tomduck.ca/>.  It may also be used to generate [GitHub Pages]; this documentation is one such example.
